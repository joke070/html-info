<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is chijoke jonathan from umuomaku village found in Orumba south local government,anambra state, nigeria.</p>

<p>I was born and brought up in northern part of nigeria, mangu,plateau state to be precise. where i started and completed my primary and secondary school before moving to the eastern part of the country(Anambra) where i started my journey in tech.</p>

<p>My love for tech started when i gruaduated from Fedral Polytechnic in Oko Anambra state 2023. Since then i have always wanted to be a web developer amd web designer. </p>
<p>It wasnt easy for me going into tech without any knowlege in computer related courses, but as a beginer i devoted most of time in learning from people who have done so much in tech and that was how i began to learn things i never knew i could learn in my life.</p>
